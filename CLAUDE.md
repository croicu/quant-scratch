# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Mission

__mission__

## Template Sync

- **Source**: [croicu/tpl-py](https://github.com/croicu/tpl-py)
- **Synced to**: <!-- SYNCED_TO --> (set by `tasks/repo_setup.md` at instantiation time; left
  unset in `tpl-py`'s own master copy of this file, since the source has nothing to sync
  against)

This repo is either `tpl-py` itself or was generated from it. `tpl-py`'s `ADDENDUM.md` is a
curated, timestamped log of changes meant for downstream instances (new/changed rules,
base-module fixes, obsoleted patterns) — routine housekeeping doesn't get an entry. Which
protocol below applies depends on which repo you're in.

### Reading the addendum (applies in an instance)

1. Fetch `tpl-py`'s `ADDENDUM.md` over plain HTTPS (e.g. `WebFetch` against the raw content
   URL) — no `gh` CLI, no `git clone`, no persistent git remote required.
2. Compare each row's timestamp against this repo's `Synced to` value above.
3. For rows newer than that, fetch only that entry's individual file under `addendum/` (not the
   whole history) and decide whether/how to apply it here.
4. After applying (or deliberately skipping) everything newer, bump `Synced to` above to the
   latest entry's timestamp.

### Writing an addendum entry (applies only in `tpl-py` itself)

1. When making a change meant for downstream instances, add a new file under `addendum/`
   (filename prefixed with an ISO timestamp) describing what changed, why, and what an instance
   should do about it.
2. Append a row to `ADDENDUM.md`'s table (timestamp, title, filename).

## Collaboration rules

- Before implementing any feature or non-trivial change, ask clarifying questions until the intent is unambiguous.
- If anything is unclear or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask — do not assume and implement.

### Task workflow

Tasks are tracked as GitHub issues in this repo, status via labels: `status:brainstorm`,
`status:implementation`, `status:testing`, `status:ready-to-submit`. There is no `status:done`
label — reaching Done means closing the issue. (These labels don't exist on a freshly-created
repo — create them with `gh label create` before the first task needs one.)

For any non-trivial feature or change, follow these stages:

1. **Brainstorm** — copy `tasks/new_task.md` to `tasks/<task-name>.md` with the problem statement; update it with conclusions as the design discussion progresses. This is scratch space for live back-and-forth — an issue isn't required at this stage, but a lightweight tracking issue labeled `status:brainstorm` can be opened for backlog visibility if wanted; either way, `tasks/<task-name>.md` (not the issue) stays the working document until the design converges.
2. **Implementation** — open a GitHub issue (`gh issue create`) with the converged problem statement + conclusions as the body, labeled `status:implementation`. Write the code. `tasks/<task-name>.md` is no longer the source of truth once the issue exists — trim it to a one-line pointer at the issue (or delete it) rather than maintaining both.
3. **Testing** — relabel the issue `status:testing`. Verify correctness; post test results and any open issues as an issue comment.
4. **Ready to Submit** — relabel `status:ready-to-submit`. Run lint + tests; confirm docs are up to date; post a closing summary comment.
5. **Done** — close the issue after merge. Delete `tasks/<task-name>.md` once the issue is closed — the issue (body + comments) is the sole source of truth from that point on, so there's no reason to keep a stale duplicate on disk. (Only applies when a real issue holds the full history; a Done task with no issue keeps its local file.)

## Before committing

Run these before every commit:

```bash
ruff format src/ tests/
ruff check src/ tests/
pytest
```

## Documentation rule

After any change that affects the public interface, CLI, or file formats, update the relevant docs:

- `CLAUDE.md` — commands, architecture notes
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — modules, data flow, contracts
- `docs/PROTOCOL.md` — CLI signature, file format schemas

## Commands

```bash
# Install (editable, with dev deps)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run
__project_name__

# Lint
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/

# Test
pytest
pytest tests/unit/test_foo.py::test_bar   # single test
```

## Architecture conventions

1. Internal processing uses strongly typed dataclasses.
2. `protocols.py` contains persisted/shared data contracts — pure data only, no behavior. Behavior that operates on protocol types belongs in a dedicated entity/service layer, not on the protocol classes themselves.
3. `contracts.py` contains runtime behavioral interfaces (`Protocol` classes for things like workers/executors), not data.
4. Tests must run offline.
5. Prefer explicit, readable Python over clever abstractions.

## Logging

- **Use `Logger`** (`from __package_name__.diagnostics import Logger`) — not bare `print()`.
- **All features log success and errors** — no silent success, no swallowed errors.
- **Message length by severity**:
  - **Success (info)** — short: feature started, feature ended.
  - **Recoverable issues (warning)** — medium: enough context to understand what went wrong and why it was non-fatal.
  - **Errors (error/fatal)** — detailed: full context needed to reproduce and diagnose.
- **Level guide**:
  - `Logger.info` — normal notable events (start, end, success, counts)
  - `Logger.warning` — recoverable problems (retries, skipped items)
  - `Logger.error` / `Logger.fatal` — unrecoverable failures
- **Categories** — every `Logger` method takes an optional `category: str = "general"`, filterable via `settings.json`'s `logCategories` (an open string, not a closed enum — `diagnostics.py` only defines `CATEGORY_GENERAL` as a starting constant). Console output is `[LEVEL][category] message`. **Effective default depends on `debug`**: if `settings.json`'s `logCategories` is left empty/absent, `debug: false` resolves it to `["general"]` (only `general` shown), `debug: true` resolves it to `[]` (unfiltered, show everything); an explicit non-empty `logCategories` always overrides this regardless of `debug`. **`excludedCategories`** is a complementary deny-list, only in effect when the resolved `logCategories` is `[]` (the true unfiltered `debug: true` state) — inert against an explicit non-empty `logCategories` or the plain `debug: false` default.

## Coding Style

- **Protocols are pure data** — `protocols.py` holds dataclasses only. No methods, no logic. Behavior lives in a separate entity/service layer.
- **Explicit over brief** — if two implementations are equivalent, choose the one that is easier to read and debug, even if it is longer.
- **No list/dict/set comprehensions** — use explicit `for` loops. Comprehensions obscure control flow and make multi-step logic harder to follow.
- **No lambdas** — use named functions or plain `for` loops. Lambdas hide intent and cannot be stepped through in a debugger.
- **Import count as SRP signal** — more than 5–10 imports in a file is a hint that the file may be doing too much. Not a hard rule, but worth pausing to consider whether responsibilities should be split.

## New Task

## Pending Tasks
- **File**: [Repo Setup](tasks/repo_setup.md)
- **Status**: Implementation
- **Key Context**: This repo was generated from a template and still contains placeholder tokens. Replace them per that file's instructions, then delete it and this entry.
